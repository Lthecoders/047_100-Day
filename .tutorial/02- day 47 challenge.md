# ðŸ‘‰ Day 47 Challenge

Alright Top Trumpers. Your program should work like this.

1. Pick a category. Something popular. You know like 'most handsome computer science teachers'. ðŸ˜†
2. Store the information of **two** different objects in a 2D dictionary.
3. The key field should be **name**.
4. The data in the sub dictionary should be some stats about the object. For example:
   1. Intelligence
   2. Handsomeness
   3. L33t c0ding skillz
   4. Baldness level
   
5. Use an infinite loop to get the user to pick one of the two cards, then pick a stat from that card.
6. Display the chosen stat for both cards and output which has won.

ðŸ¥³ Extra points for:
- Making the dictionary dynamic so you can add your own cards.
- Using a loop to play the game in a 2 player format, keeping track of points scored.

Example:
